Domain and time only filter candidates; they do not establish association. For non-HTTP findings such as TCP, uncaptured traffic, or no exact match, omit this field or pass [], retain other verifiable evidence such as command output or logs in evidence, and preferably explain why traffic was not bound. Do not guess IDs or repeat probes solely to obtain traffic."
